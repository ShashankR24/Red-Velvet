Red velvet cake is much more than vanilla cake tinted red. This recipe produces the best red velvet cake with superior buttery, vanilla, and cocoa flavors, as well as a delicious tang from buttermilk. My trick is to whip the egg whites, which guarantees a smooth velvet crumb.


Ingredients
Cake:

 2 and 1/2 cups (340g) all-purpose flour
 1/4 cup (35g) cornstarch
 2 tablespoons (12g) unsweetened cocoa powder (any kind works)

 3/4 teaspoon salt
